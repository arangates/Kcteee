*KCTEEE

An integrated motor monitoring system which collects data from 3-phase Induction motor  and stores data in thingspeak.com.

also the sensor data is displayed in Liquid Crystal Display (LCD).

Monitoring units at the motor control center collects load voltage, load current, speed and temperature of the motor. The Real-time graph provides load current and historical data on the motor for analyses conducted at the motor or at the motor control center.

Additionally the motor monitoring system has the capability of controlling the motor and shutdown of motor at abnormal condition.

Components USED :

1.Potential Trnsformer (230v - 6v)
2.Current Transformer
3.Proximity sensor
4.Temperature Sensor (LM-235)
5.ESP8266 -WiFi module 
6.Arduino Uno
